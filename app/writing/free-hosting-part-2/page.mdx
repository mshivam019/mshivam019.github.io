In **Part 1**, we covered **free hosting options for front-end applications**. But what about your back-end, database, and storage? A full-stack project often requires **authentication, APIs, data storage, and media hosting** — and yes, you can get all of this for **free** too!

In this guide, we'll explore some of the best **free-tier back-end hosting, database, and storage solutions** to help you deploy your applications without breaking the bank.

Let's dive in!

## Backend

Hosting a back-end service is a complicated task and can get messy, however if you know how to do it well, it definitely makes you stand out. I was famous for hosting back-end services at my university especially because I could do it for free and I knew about common errors, one might face like CORS policy.

[**Render**](http://render.com)**:**
This was my go to tool for hosting most of my college projects, It could handle node.js, spring boot projects, pretty much anything with the power of docker, It has **512MB RAM** and **0.1 CPU**. It has Free 750 Instance hour, Bandwidth of 100 GB, 500 Pipeline Minutes, _It does have Free postgres DB but do not use it as has 30 Day limit period_.
