Back when I was still in college, I started working on a lot of projects. Other students did the same, but to gain an edge, I turned to hosting and cloud services. This led me down a deep rabbit hole of FREE VPS Services, Dockerfiles and many other things.

I have been approached by many of my colleagues, classmates and even random strangers on reddit to help them host their college project, freelance gig or their brand-new SaaS products.

So here it is: a one stop guide to Free hosting, yes you heard it correctly, everything here either provides a free tier or has freemium pricing model.

Let’s get started!

## Frontend

At this point, I think everyone knows how to host a website. However if you're still looking for alternatives here's everything I have used so far.

1. [Vercel](http://vercel.com) — Allows server less functions, server config, image optimizations with Next.js and free PostgreSQL.
2. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) — Easy Static Deployment.
3. [CloudFlare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/) — Requires a bit more setup but it's a great option for both websites and server less functions.
4. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) — Allows server less function and server config.
5. [Cyclic.sh](http://Cyclic.sh) — Offers AWS S3 and dynamo DB, with a limit of 3 apps.

While hosting a website is relatively simple, there are many things that can go wrong, which creates plenty of opportunities to learn.

Some key points to consider:

- Use GitHub Pages if you only have simple HTML files and are experimenting with things. There's a lot that can be done using GitHub Pages and Jekyll (also, while you're here, study static site generators and try one).
- Don't create a brand-new Vercel project for a "Hello World" index.html.

If you're hosting a simple Vite (React) project, you might run into an issue where if you directly enter the route to a specific page, or reloading a random page results in a **404 error**, this a common issue and quite popular in the ReactJS Ecosystem. However you are using Next.js you might have never even heard of this issue.

Here's a popular Stack Overflow thread from where I learned about this:
[Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27928372/react-router-urls-dont-work-when-refreshing-or-writing-manually). So, What's the solution I used? I created a catch-all and called it a day as it was just my college project and no one cared except me. It did help me during an interview, though.

Here's the code which worked for my vercel deployment. Just create a `vercel.json` file and put it the root directory. Example project [here](https://github.com/mshivam019/mood-swinger).

```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

For Netlify, create a `netlify.toml` file and place it in the root directory:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
  force = false
```

### Bonus

If you don't really trust these providers to host your website or you want to try something different, consider running [Coolify](https://coolify.io/self-hosted) or [Docker](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying#docker-image) locally on your own machine.

## Authentication

If you're here, chances are your web application is about to be **flooded with millions of users** (or, realistically, maybe one person every other week). Either way, you'll need a **basic authentication layer** to:

- Prevent API spam
- Avoid database flooding with junk requests

So here are my top picks:

**Auth0**

- **Benefits**: A flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to applications. Supports multiple identity providers and offers extensive documentation.
- **Pain Points**: The free tier has limitations on the number of active users and may not include advanced features.

_Fun fact: Even ChatGPT uses Auth0!_ I once integrated it into a **Spring Boot** application.

**Auth.js (NextAuth)**

- **Benefits**: A complete open-source authentication solution for Next.js applications. Supports various sign-in methods, including OAuth, magic email and credentials.
- **Pain Points**: The new version is a bit stable and you might not get everything that you need here as its is a bit tricky to setup.

**Clerk**

- **Benefits**: Provides a suite of authentication and user management solutions with pre-built components. Supports multi-factor authentication and social logins.
- **Pain Points**: The free tier has limitations on the number of active users and may not include advanced features.

**Build Your OWN**

If you are here then, few advises:

- Use **OTP-based sign-in** — never store passwords, No passwords = no data leaks.
- OTP sign-in also removes the need for a `"Forgot Password"` flow.
- When using **JWT authentication**, always **extract the user from the JWT payload** instead of sending it separately in the **body, URL, or query parameters** — this avoids **data leaks.**
- Do remember about **authorization** as well, setting roles and types of users and even making organizations
- Another important decision is about merging user accounts, what to do if a user initially signed up using an email address but next time prefers an OAuth service like Google sign-in.

Here's my GitHub project with [Auth.js](https://github.com/mshivam019/designered).

P.S: Before copy-pasting anything, **check the version** and follow the documentation.

All the best! And don't forget to read Part 2, where I cover **Back-end, Database, and Storage solutions.**
